				<h1>My self-summary</h1>
			<p>My dedication to quality and learning makes me feel at home in
				technology. As a hobbyist developer, my skills and experiences
				are efficiently applied as a QA tester. Studying computer science
				and having built multiple client and server side applications has
				allowed me to continue to develop my skills as an effective communicator
				 and colleague.</p>
				 <h1>What Iâ€™ve worked on</h1>
		 <p>Various applications within Dollar Shave Club such as backend
			 rails servers, debugging issues with colleagues, and ensuring our
			 high-performing Ember application is deployed bug-free.</p>
		 <h1>Side Projects</h1>

				 <p> I have built a couple hobby projects. Noteworthy pieces of software
					I've built is a daily bible verse application that shows a
					new bible verse every day. Strategizing and modeling a future
					application I'd like to build one day.</p>
		 <h1>What I'm looking to do next</h1>
		 <p>I'm looking to continue to develop my skills as a QA tester while
			 having fun in the process!</p>
